# Python NLP Text Adventure
A text-adventure game developed to learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP). The game loop code and and the parser was made following this course: http://interactive-fiction-class.org/lectures.html. Other modifications are mine.

## Features
- A dialogue system initiated through the 'use' command.
- I'll list more later.

## Getting started
Just fork and pull. When you have a branch on your machine, find the directory and type `python3 play.py`. It should start the game from the beginning. NOTE: The game will only proceed until you get to the basement, then you won't be able to do much more except move about the rooms.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7.7+

### Building your own game
To build your own game, check out the 'play.py' file and 

### TODO
- Create a search command that may or may not reveal more about items/NPCs based on preconditions
- Create visibility flag for items
- Fully implement NPCs, which are a subclass of Item (for now)
